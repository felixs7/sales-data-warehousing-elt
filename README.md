# sales-data-warehousing-elt

dbt project to create a Data Warehouse for a Grocery Store.
The final Warehouse consists of 2 dim tables (Payment & Product) and 1 fact table (Sales) all sourced from 2 transactional tables.


Project Setup:

Use the 2 .csv files in the data/ folder to setup your source tables. In this example I use Snowflake as a Cloud Warehouse.
